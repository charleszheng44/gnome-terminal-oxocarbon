### [Gnome Terminal](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Terminal)

#### Install

This theme can be installed on Gnome 3 terminal and any other Gnome based terminal program like the Unity terminal bundled with Ubuntu.

You'll need the `dconf` command (if you run a recent Gnome version). In arch based distros, this can be installed by running:

    ```shell
    sudo pacman -S dconf 
    ```

In other distros you'll need to dig around to find it, search your repositories for __dconf__ related packages.

After installing dconf, you can clone this repository to your machine.
    
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/charleszheng44/gnome-terminal
    cd gnome-terminal
    ```

Then you can run the installation script:
    
    ```shell
    ./install.sh
    ```

And just follow the steps.
